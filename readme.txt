Redundant plugin which should no longer be used.

== Description ==

This is a redundant plugin which should no longer be used. It's functionality has now been added into the core of WordPress and so no longer serves any purpose. If you already have this plugin installed, you should uninstall it since it serves no purpose any longer.

Adds a "Customizer" link to the "Appearance" menu in WordPress. This is useful for providing a convenient go to
place for your site admins to edit the design without having to go to the themes page.

The creation of this plugin was sponsored by the <a href="http://www.dss.dep.no/">Norwegian Government Administration Services (G.A.S.)</a> and <a href="http://metronet.no/">Metronet</a>.

== Installation ==

Either install the plugin via the WordPress admin panel, or ... 

1. Upload `customizer-link` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

There are no configuration options in this plugin. Simply navigate to "Appearance" > "Customizer" to reach your theme customizer.

Note: This will only work on themes which support the theme customizer.
